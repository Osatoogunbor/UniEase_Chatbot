### Q: Why is leaving home so challenging when someone at home is ill?
A:  
- You may be used to caring for or worrying about a family member.

- Choosing to leave home for university can feel complicated or guilt-inducing.

### Q: What if I’m unsure about leaving home now?
A:  
- It’s normal to feel worried or uncertain if you don’t know how an illness will progress.  
- Putting your life on hold indefinitely might not be ideal since you can’t predict the future.  
- You could consider a stay-at-home gap year, deferring your place if needed, or planning ways to move on with your life while remaining at home.

### Q: How can I prepare if I do decide to move away?
A:  
- Work out travel logistics if family members are unable to help (trains, buses, or lifts from friends).  
- Consider sending some belongings ahead or buying items after you arrive.  
- Borrowing from flatmates is a good way to pack lighter and make new connections.  
- If leaving home doesn’t feel right, talk to your family or explore deferral options with the university/UCAS.

### Q: What are some tips for living away from home when someone is ill?

- Use agreed times for phone calls so you aren’t anxious about every incoming call.  
- Consider Skype or video calls to see for yourself how things are at home.  
- Set up an emergency contact system (one person who can inform others if something serious happens).  
- Speak with your university about pastoral care, counselling, or support groups.  
- If needed, let tutors know you may need to keep your phone on during lectures and why.

  - Let friends or flatmates know what you’re going through so they understand if you’re occasionally absent or upset.  
  - Explore local or online support groups, such as Student Minds or Hope Support Services.  
- Schedule short breaks or “me time” to switch off your phone, walk, nap, or do any activity that helps you relax.  
- Ask for help if you’re overwhelmed—friends, tutors, the university, or a counsellor can all provide support.

### Q: How do I handle responsibilities I used to have at home?
A:  
- Talk with your family about which tasks you usually cover and who might take them on now.

- If you still want to help, consider tasks you can do remotely, such as placing online shopping orders or making supportive calls.  
- Remember that you can continue to support your family emotionally even if you’re not physically there.

### Q: What happens when I visit home?

### Q: How can I stay positive despite the challenges?
A:  
- Notice your achievements: you’ve started university, you’re building independence, and you’re pursuing your goals.  
- Celebrate small wins, such as meeting deadlines, improving your cooking skills, or finding supportive friends.  
- Focus on the benefits of leaving home: learning to manage finances, meet new people, and explore your future career path.
