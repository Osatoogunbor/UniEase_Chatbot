## Extenuating Circumstances at University of Wolverhampton

### Q: What are extenuating circumstances?
**A:**  
- Extenuating circumstances recognize that you have been unable to complete assessments due to circumstances beyond your control.  
- If granted, your assessment is deferred until the next published opportunity (which may be a re-sit attempt).  
- You must submit evidence to support your claim.  
- Your assessment may be pushed into the following academic year, which can incur additional costs or affect progression.  
- Extenuating circumstances are for medium-term delays and are not usually applied to multiple attempts of the same assessment for the same issue.  
- If you cannot attempt the next opportunity, consider taking a leave of absence until your circumstances improve.  
- More info:  
  - [Fit to Sit and Extenuating Circumstances Policy](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/about-us/corporate-information/wlv-policies/fit-to-sit-and-extenuating-circumstances-policy-and-procedure/)

### Q: Where can I apply for extenuating circumstances?
**A:**  
- Log into e:Vision via the University website or MyWLV app.  
- From the homepage, click on Assessments, then Extenuating Circumstances and Extensions.  
- Select Extenuating Circumstances, and choose the affected module and assessment.

### Q: When can I apply for extenuating circumstances?
**A:**  
- You can apply 28 days before the assessment deadline set on the system (visible on your Canvas submission portal or exam timetable on e:Vision).

### Q: For which assessments can I apply for extenuating circumstances?
**A:**  
- You can apply for any assessment used in the grade calculation for a module.  
- Extenuating circumstances are not available for formative assessments that do not contribute to your module grade.  
- If your assessment builds towards a larger assessment, such as a proposal or preliminary task, speak with your module team to confirm if both require claims.

### Q: Can I apply for Extenuating Circumstances for modules involving placement learning or practical assessments?
**A:**  
- Yes, but depending on your course, your Course Leaders may make the final decision (for example, Nursing, Paramedic Science, Physiotherapy).  
- You should still apply in the same way through e:Vision.

### Q: The assessment I wish to apply for is not showing. What do I do?
**A:**  
- Check if the assessment deadline is less than 28 days away. If not, wait until it is within 28 days.  
- If it is within 28 days and the assessment is still not visible, ensure you can see the submission portal on Canvas or have been allocated the exam on your e:Vision timetable.  
- If you cannot see the portal or exam details, log a helpcall stating you wish to apply, including:  
  - Module name, code, and specific assessment (if more than one)  
  - Any evidence for your claim

### Q: What evidence do I need for my extenuating circumstances claim to be granted?
**A:**  
- Evidence should clearly state your name (if applicable) and cover the date of the assessment submission you are claiming for.  
- Examples include a doctor’s note or a letter from a third party.  
- Lateral Flow Test results or COVID Positive Test results alone are not accepted.  
- Personal photographs (for example, injuries) are not appropriate evidence.  
- If you are unsure about acceptable evidence, log a helpcall for advice.

### Q: I am known to the University's Mental Health and Wellbeing Team. Can they write a letter of support for my Extenuating Circumstances claim?
**A:**  
- The Mental Health and Wellbeing Team may support your claim if you have an established relationship and they are fully aware of your difficulties.  
- You should not register with the team only for a letter of support if you do not wish to receive continued help.

### Q: I have a disclosed disability and receive support/adjustments. Can I use my disability as a reason for Extenuating Circumstances?
**A:**  
- Each claim is assessed individually. If adjustments and support are already in place, a claim may not be accepted for that reason alone.  
- If your condition has worsened leading up to the assessment deadline, a doctor’s note or further evidence should be provided to show this.

### Q: How long does it take to get a decision on my extenuating circumstances claim?
**A:**  
- A decision can take up to 10 working days.

### Q: My deadline has passed, but I still haven't received a decision. What do I do?
**A:**  
- It can take up to 5 working days for your claim to be assessed.  
- If your deadline passes during this time, do not submit your assessment; submitting implies you are fit to sit and invalidates the claim.  
- There is no penalty for receiving a decision after the deadline, as long as you submitted before the deadline.

### Q: My deadline has passed, but I did not make a claim. Can I still do this?
**A:**  
- If you submitted any part of the assessment, you cannot claim extenuating circumstances (you have declared yourself fit to sit).  
- If no submission was made and the deadline was in the last 10 working days, log a helpcall with:  
  - Confirmation you wish to apply  
  - Module name, code, assessment info  
  - Any supporting evidence  
- Claims are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. After 10 working days, you would need to make an Academic Appeal.  
  - [Academic Appeals - University of Wolverhampton](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/current-students/conduct-and-appeals/academic-appeals/)

### Q: My claim is set to pending. What does this mean?
**A:**  
- It means the evidence provided was not sufficient.  
- You should have received an email detailing what additional evidence is needed.  
- If you are unsure, log a helpcall for clarification.

### Q: My claim has been declined. Can I appeal this decision?
**A:**  
- Attach additional evidence to an e:Vision helpcall within 10 working days of the claim being declined.  
- The Extenuating Circumstances Panel will review the new evidence.  
- In your helpcall, include:  
  - Confirmation you wish to appeal  
  - Module name, code, and assessment details

### Q: I have been granted extenuating circumstances but still wish to submit my work. Can I do this?
**A:**  
- Yes, if the deadline has not passed.  
- First, cancel your extenuating circumstances claim on e:Vision (My Study → Modules → Extensions and Extenuating Circumstances → Extenuating Circumstances).  
- After cancelling, you can submit your work via Canvas.  
- For in-class tests, exams, or presentations, attending automatically cancels your claim when your grade is recorded.

### Q: I am an LPC student and want information on applying for extenuating circumstances. Who can I speak to?
**A:**  
- Speak to your Assessments Tutor in the Legal Practice Course Team.  
- The process uses a POG34 form found on the LPC Canvas Noticeboard. Do not use the standard e:Vision claim form for Legal Practice Modules.  
- Exception: 7LW022 (Legal Research Methods and Dissertation) is part of the LLM LPC but is not a Legal Practice module—apply via e:Vision for that module.

### Q: I have previously applied for extenuating circumstances. Can I apply again?
**A:**  
- You can apply multiple times for the same assessment in certain cases:  
  - If your previous claim was declined and the deadline has not passed, you can appeal that decision.  
  - If your circumstances are continuing, you may need new evidence explaining why you expected improvement by this stage.  
  - If your circumstances have worsened, provide updated evidence.  
- If your circumstances are long-term, discuss with your personal tutor about possibly taking a leave of absence.

## Skills for Learning: Guide to Time Management

### Q: What is time management?
**A:**  
- Time management is about taking control of your schedule rather than rushing to meet deadlines.  
- It involves planning ahead, setting goals, and prioritizing tasks.  
- The goal is to reduce pressure and work more efficiently.  

---

### Q: Why is time management important?
**A:**  
- University work often includes overlapping deadlines, making it easy to feel overwhelmed.  
- Working right up to deadlines can reduce the time needed for reflection, affecting work quality.  
- Effective time management helps you balance academic tasks with personal commitments.  
- It can lessen anxiety, increase self-awareness, and decrease the temptation to avoid challenging tasks.  

---

### Q: How can I track my time effectively?
**A:**  
- Keep a simple time log or chart to see how you spend your day.  
- Note small pockets of free time (for example, during commutes) that could be used for quick study sessions or reviewing notes.  

---

### Q: How do I plan ahead for the semester?
**A:**  
- List all your important dates (lectures, exams, assignment deadlines) at the start of term.  
- Add personal commitments to spot weeks that might be busier than usual.  
- Use a calendar or planner (wall chart, phone app) for a clear visual overview.  
- Make a weekly plan to set goals and stay on track, and use a daily to-do list if needed.  

---

### Q: Why should I prioritize tasks?
**A:**  
- Some tasks have urgent deadlines or are worth a larger percentage of your grade.  
- Focusing on the most critical tasks first helps you use your time effectively.  
- Less important or more enjoyable tasks should come after meeting urgent priorities.  

---

### Q: What does it mean to study smart?
**A:**  
- Use active reading, note-taking, and reflection instead of passive reading.  
- Emphasize outcomes rather than hours (for example, aim to master specific topics instead of studying for a set amount of time).  

---

### Q: How do I time-plan an assignment?
**A:**  
- Break the work into stages (researching, drafting, proofreading).  
- Start from the due date and schedule mini-deadlines for each stage.  
- Review your lecture notes soon after classes to save time later.  
- Consider reading ahead of lectures to improve your understanding.  

---

### Q: Why should I take regular breaks?
**A:**  
- Studying when tired lowers efficiency and wastes time.  
- Scheduling study sessions during your most alert hours helps you work better.  
- Prepare materials beforehand and minimize distractions to stay focused.  
- If dedicating an entire day to study, outline goals and activities to avoid losing track of time.
