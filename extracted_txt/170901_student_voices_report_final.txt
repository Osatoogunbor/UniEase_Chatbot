## Methodology

### Q: How was the Student Perspectives Questionnaire (SPQ) conducted?
A:  
- In February 2017, students were invited (via Student Minds’ social media and NUS) to complete a survey on mental health at university.  
- 134 students responded; 127 (95%) reported personal experience of mental health difficulties.  
- Most said their mental health problems started before university; 22 said they started at university.  
- The majority (112) identified their mental health issues as ongoing; 93 had an official diagnosis.  

### Q: What is the Student Voice Forum (SVF)?
A:  
- A small discussion group run in partnership with NUS and UUK.  
- Two meetings were held, each facilitated by Student Minds staff using a “Design Thinking” approach (discovery, interpretation, ideation).  
- Session 1 covered experiences of mental health at university and using support services.  
- Session 2 covered academic experience, barriers to support, and ways to thrive.

### Q: Who participated in the Student Voice Forum?
A:  
- Initially, 17 students plus 3 Nightline volunteers were invited based on diverse experiences, year groups, and course types.  
- The actual attendance was smaller, and the first session was 10 people (all white cis-women). The second session had 6 attendees.  
- This lack of representation highlights the need for better outreach to underrepresented groups (e.g., BAME, international, male students).  

### Q: Were participants satisfied with the Student Voice Forum?
A:  
- Yes. Feedback indicated that members felt empowered to share and influence discussions about student mental health.  
- Many appreciated hearing diverse perspectives outside their own institution.  
- Attendees reported increased confidence in advocating for improvements.

## Student Perspectives on Mental Health

### Q: Why do students think it is important to talk about mental health?
A:  
- **Reducing stigma:** Many students feel open conversations help challenge stigma and normalise mental health difficulties.  
- **Encouraging help-seeking:** Speaking more openly helps individuals recognize their own symptoms, feel less alone, and know when to seek support.  
- **Meeting the need for support:** University can be stressful; acknowledging mental health challenges ensures proper services and interventions.

### Q: How do students define "mental health"?
A:  
- A **healthy mind** focusing on emotional well-being (rather than simply happiness).  
- A **diverse and complex continuum** that can shift over time.  
- **Ability to cope:** Many equate good mental health with being able to handle life’s challenges, though few highlight the possibility of proactively building stronger mental health.  

### Q: How do students feel about mental health at university?
A:  
- Most respondents see mental health as something everyone has.  
- They note that the pressure to excel academically and socially can intensify stress.  
- A portion stated that their problems began pre-university but worsened or became more apparent once they arrived.

## Prevention of Mental Health Difficulties

### Q: What do students say could help prevent mental health issues?
A:  
- **Support, understanding, and information:** Early awareness, proactive identification, and more consistent follow-up if they reach out for help.  
- **More mental health literacy:** Helping students and staff understand signs and symptoms.  
- **Changing the university environment:**  
  - Manage academic pressure through clearer communication and structured support.  
  - Offer financial and practical guidance (e.g., even rent installments).  
  - Provide more inclusive social events, not solely centered on alcohol.  
- **Better transitions:** For those with prior diagnoses, bridging the gap between home and campus or CAMHS and adult services.

## The Academic Experience

### Q: How does academic life impact mental health?
A:  
- **Role of academic tutors:** Students value compassionate tutors who understand mental health and can signpost to further help. However, not all tutors feel prepared for that role.  
- **Expectations and course clarity:** Students want clear communication on workload, deadlines, and available academic support.  
- **Flexibility:** Some suggest recorded lectures, flexible attendance, or extended deadlines help them cope when mental health symptoms worsen.  
- **Timetabling and workload:** Properly spaced deadlines, consistent feedback, and accessible staff can reduce academic stress.

## Accessing Support: Overview

### Q: Where do students seek mental health support?
A:  
- **GP and NHS referrals:** 88% of students with difficulties sought help from a GP. 58% were referred to NHS services.  
- **University counselling:** 77% of those who saw a GP also used campus counselling.  
- **Mental health advisors:** About a third accessed a specialist mental health advisor.  
- **Friends and family:** 74% reached out to friends; 54% leaned on family.  
- **DSA and adjustments:** 42 received or were eligible for Disabled Students’ Allowances (DSA); 47 mentioned exam or coursework adjustments.

## University Provision: Experiences and Expectations

### Q: What do students expect universities to provide?
A:  
- **Professional mental health services (e.g., counselling).**  
- A more proactive approach to fostering mental health, rather than focusing only on crisis support.  
- **Informed academic staff**—some training in mental health awareness and appropriate signposting.  
- **Clear signposting** to external services if needed.

### Q: What have students found most helpful in practice?
A:  
- **Professional services:** 25 found counselling beneficial; some praised mental health advisors or a DSA-funded mentor.  
- **Academic flexibility:** Adjusted deadlines, supportive tutors who provide clarity.  
- **Peer support and social culture:** Encouraging open discussions, fostering a sense of community, and offering non-alcohol-based activities.  
- **Some found “nothing helpful,”** citing waiting lists, lack of awareness, or an inadequate service.

### Q: What about advocacy or care coordination?
A:  
- Students note fragmentation between campus and external services.  
- They suggest an “advocate” who understands both academic and health systems, facilitating referrals, clarifying regulations, and supporting them in meetings.

## Other Support Options

### Q: Do students value peer support and social networks?
A:  
- Yes. Many rely on friends and housemates for day-to-day emotional help.  
- Peer-led groups, welfare reps, or societies can be important but sometimes raise privacy/confidentiality concerns.  
- Students want more guidance on how to help friends in crisis and how to maintain their own well-being while supporting others.

### Q: How do NHS services fit into the picture?
A:  
- Experiences vary widely. Some appreciate GPs who listen empathetically; others face issues like short appointment times, unhelpful referrals, or moving between different locations.  
- Transitioning from child/adolescent services (CAMHS) to adult services can cause gaps in care.

## Barriers to Support

### Q: What stops students from seeking or continuing support?
A:  
- **Long waiting lists:** Most common complaint (waiting weeks or months to see a counsellor).  
- **Short appointment limits:** A few sessions may not suffice, leaving students feeling dismissed or unhelped.  
- **Fear of judgment or “not being ill enough”:** Students may worry about using scarce resources.  
- **Paperwork and complex referral processes:** Long forms, repeated re-tellings of one’s story, or confusion about how to access services.  
- **Service logistics:** Travel, scheduling, or transferring between home/university GPs.

## Students’ Vision of a Whole-University Approach

### Q: What do students want in an ideal university culture?
A:  
- **An open, stigma-free environment** that normalizes seeking help.  
- **Proactive focus on well-being** with prevention programs, study advice, and social opportunities that don’t revolve around alcohol.  
- **Inclusive academic environment:** Tutors who balance academic demands with concern for mental health, flexibility around deadlines, and opportunities for personal growth.  
- **Easily accessible, joined-up services** where staff know how to signpost or offer timely support.

### Q: What are the key suggestions from the Student Voice Forum?
A:  
- **Expand service capacity** so wait times are shorter, with out-of-hours support where possible.  
- **Improve staff training** (tutors, lecturers, welfare teams) to ensure consistent mental health knowledge.  
- **Enhance communication and collaboration** across different departments (academic, disability, counselling, external NHS).  
- **Offer more flexible academic practices** (e.g., recorded lectures, optional attendance, compassion around deadlines).  
- **Foster a culture of mental health awareness** (campus-wide campaigns, mental health education in induction, peer-led or buddy systems).

## Appendix: Additional Methodology Details

### Q: How was the Student Voice Forum structured?
A:  
- Used a “Design Thinking” or “Problem-Based Learning” method with five stages: Discovery, Interpretation, Ideation, Experiment, Evolution.  
- The SVF followed the first three phases, focusing on shared experiences, brainstorming solutions, and generating ideas.  
- Participants created ground rules for open discussion, privacy, and respect.  

### Q: What specific activities took place in the Student Voice Forum?
A:  
- **Session 1:**  
  - Individual mapping of personal mental health journeys.  
  - Group discussion on accessing and navigating support services.  
  - “Creative ideation” around barriers to services and what universities should provide.  
  - Developing a key list of “wishes” or “asks” for universities.  
- **Session 2:**  
  - Discussion on academic life, mental health, and the meaning of “thriving.”  
  - Emphasis on realistic workloads, flexible learning, and staff training.  

### Q: Any final notes on this project?
A:  
- The report acknowledges that these findings are not exhaustive nor fully representative of all students.  
- Going forward, it is essential to include more underrepresented students (BAME, LGBTQ+, international, disabled, etc.).  
- The ultimate goal is a genuinely inclusive, whole-university approach to student mental health where student voices shape policy and practice.
